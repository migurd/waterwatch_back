## TODO
- Develop endpoints for 4th phone screen. Maintenance data
- Create a middleware that when an already logged in user can't interact with something that isn't theirs. Like an address that doesn't belong to them, so they wouldn't be able to create an address not related with them or update an address that isn't theirs (cyber security)
- Implement Firebase, so user can register, login, and we can send emails to the user email
- (Probably no) Validate that both employee and client say that the work has been finished, so the employee doesn't leave a non-finished job
- (Probably no) 2nd screen and 2.5, return LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH instead of numbers between 0 and 100
- Refactor? (nah, we ball)
